    Hello, My name is James Gates, and I am currently going to DCCC to get my associates degree
    in video game development. This is my third year at DCCC. I am currently working at Charlies Hameburgers as a dishwasher. I know how to code a little bit in a couple different languages like Java, HTML, and CSS. I am very interested in making video games with stories that people will enjoy all over the world.
